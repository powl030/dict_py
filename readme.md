This is a simple programm which gives a definition of a given word.

#Simply type in a word and hit enter.
#If the word doesnt exist, the app will give you a close match to your input, which you have to accept with "y" oder decline with "n".

It also detects writing errors and provides the clostest match.
This app was build within the Python Mega Course on Udemy.
This is my first Python app.
